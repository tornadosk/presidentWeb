			<h1 className={title()}>College Dance Development</h1>

			<br />
			<p className="mb-4">To bring college dancing within USA Dance to the same level as other collegiate sports leagues, we’re going to take a more personalized and community-driven approach. This isn’t just about building a league; it’s about creating a vibrant pathway that connects young dancers to a lifelong passion for dance, fostering both personal and competitive growth.
			</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Creating a College Dance Community</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Imagine a network where every college dance team feels like part of a larger dance family. We’ll start by setting up a clear framework that allows colleges to establish or expand their dance programs. This framework will include guidelines for competitions, training resources, and a roadmap for creating successful dance teams. Our goal is to make sure every college dancer knows they have a place in USA Dance, whether they’re just starting out or already seasoned competitors.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Forging Strong College Partnerships</p>
			<p className="mb-4">But we can’t do this alone. We’ll partner with colleges and universities to support the growth of their dance programs. Whether it’s providing funding for uniforms and travel or offering specialized training for coaches, we’ll make sure each college team has what it needs to succeed. And we’ll work closely with athletic departments to integrate dance into the broader college sports culture, giving dance the recognition it deserves.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Launching a College Dance League</p>
			<p className="mb-4">This isn’t just about individual events—we’re creating a full-fledged college dance league under the USA Dance banner. This league will manage competitions, set policies, and ensure that every team is supported and connected. It’s not just about dancing; it’s about creating a community where every participant feels they’re part of something bigger.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Telling the Story of College Dance</p>
			<p className="mb-4">To grow this community, we’ll need to tell its story. Through targeted marketing and media strategies, we’ll showcase the excitement of college dance. From live-streaming competitions to creating behind-the-scenes content, we’ll bring the energy and passion of college dance to a wider audience. By collaborating with sports networks and local media, we’ll ensure that college dance gets the spotlight it deserves.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Growing Future Leaders in Dance</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Our investment in college dance isn’t just about competition—it’s about creating a pathway to lifelong involvement in dance. We’ll offer training programs for both dancers and coaches, helping them develop the skills they need to succeed at the college level and beyond. And as these dancers graduate, they’ll have a natural path to continue their journey through local USA Dance chapters and DanceSport competitions.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Connecting College Dancers to the Broader Dance Community</p>
			<p className="mb-4">We’re not just building a league; we’re building the future of USA Dance. As college dancers finish their studies, we’ll connect them to local chapters, ensuring they stay involved in the dance community. This will help grow our membership and bring fresh talent and energy into DanceSport. Imagine the impact as thousands of college dancers join USA Dance chapters across the country, enriching our community with their skills, enthusiasm, and new ideas.</p>
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Engaging Alumni and the Community</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Finally, we’ll tap into the power of alumni and local communities. Alumni can offer mentorship, support, and even sponsorship, while local communities can rally behind their college teams, helping with event attendance and fundraising. This creates a strong, supportive network that benefits everyone involved.</p>
			<br />
			<p className="text-xl font-bold mt-8">
				By taking these steps, we’re not just developing a college dance program—we’re creating a vibrant, interconnected dance community that will feed into USA Dance’s broader mission, bringing new members and energy into our chapters and DanceSport competitions. This isn’t just a plan; it’s a movement.
