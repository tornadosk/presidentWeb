			<p className="mb-4">To develop Breaking (breakdancing) within USA Dance, the plan will focus on integrating this dynamic and culturally rich dance form into the organization’s structure while fostering its growth at both grassroots and competitive levels. Recognizing Breaking's recent inclusion in the Olympics, USA Dance aims to create a vibrant Breaking community that attracts a new generation of dancers and positions the U.S. as a global leader in this sport.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">The first step in this plan is to build a solid foundation through community engagement and partnerships. USA Dance will collaborate with established breaking communities, local crews, and influential figures in the scene to ensure that the programs we develop are authentic and resonate with dancers. Initial efforts will focus on organizing local and regional events, such as jam sessions, workshops, and small-scale competitions, to build trust and engagement with the Breaking community. These events will serve as entry points for dancers of all skill levels, encouraging participation and helping to establish a nationwide network of breakers connected to USA Dance.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">To support the development of competitive Breaking, USA Dance will introduce a structured pathway that mirrors the progression in other DanceSport disciplines. This pathway will begin with grassroots initiatives, such as beginner and intermediate workshops, that focus on foundational skills and the culture of Breaking. From there, dancers can advance to more competitive events, culminating in regional and national championships. These competitions will be designed to align with the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) guidelines, ensuring that American breakers are prepared to compete on the world stage, including at the Olympics.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">One of the key elements of this plan is the creation of a National Breaking Championship, which will become the flagship event for USA Dance's Breaking division. This competition will bring together the best breakers from across the country, offering them a platform to showcase their skills and earn recognition at the highest levels. The National Championship will also serve as a qualifier for international competitions, providing a clear pathway for U.S. dancers to compete globally.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">In addition to competition-focused initiatives, USA Dance will emphasize education and community-building within the Breaking scene. This will include the development of educational programs that cover both the technical aspects of Breaking and its rich cultural history. By offering these programs online and in-person, USA Dance will make them accessible to a wide audience, including those in underserved communities. Partnerships with schools and community centers will be crucial in introducing Breaking to younger generations, helping to nurture the next wave of talent.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Special events will play a significant role in building the Breaking community within USA Dance. These events will range from local jams and workshops to national festivals that celebrate Breaking culture. By creating spaces where breakers can connect, share, and learn from one another, USA Dance will foster a strong sense of community and belonging. Additionally, these events will help to raise the profile of Breaking within the broader dance community and beyond.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">To ensure the long-term sustainability of the Breaking division, USA Dance will focus on securing sponsorships and partnerships with brands that align with Breaking’s urban and youth-driven culture. These partnerships will provide financial support for events, education programs, and travel for competitors, while also helping to promote Breaking to a wider audience. Merchandise, media coverage, and digital content, such as live streams and documentaries, will further enhance the visibility and appeal of Breaking within and outside the dance community.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Finally, USA Dance will work closely with WDSF to ensure that American Breaking is fully integrated into the global DanceSport scene. This collaboration will include aligning competition formats, judging criteria, and athlete development programs with international standards. By doing so, USA Dance will position itself as a leader in the global Breaking community, offering U.S. dancers the opportunity to excel both nationally and internationally.</p>
			<p className="mb-4">Through this comprehensive plan, USA Dance aims to create a thriving Breaking division that honors the dance's cultural roots while providing a structured pathway for competitive success. This initiative will not only enrich the offerings of USA Dance but also contribute to the growth and recognition of Breaking as a legitimate and respected sport worldwide.</p>
