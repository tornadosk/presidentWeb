			<p className="mb-4">The development of DanceSport within USA Dance, in collaboration with the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), will focus on expanding and enhancing competitive dance in the United States. This partnership aims to elevate the status of DanceSport by aligning with international standards, promoting greater athlete development, and fostering a stronger connection between national and global dance communities.

				The first step involves strengthening the relationship with WDSF to ensure that USA Dance's competitive framework is fully aligned with international regulations. By adopting WDSF's rules, judging criteria, and competition formats, USA Dance will create a seamless pathway for American athletes to compete internationally. This alignment will not only enhance the credibility of national competitions but also provide a clear trajectory for dancers aiming to represent the U.S. in global events, including the World Championships and other title events.

				USA Dance will also invest in the development of its athlete base by implementing structured training programs that mirror WDSF’s athlete development models. This includes the introduction of coaching certifications, workshops, and seminars led by top international coaches and judges. By providing American dancers with access to world-class training, USA Dance aims to raise the overall standard of DanceSport in the country, ensuring that its athletes are competitive on the world stage.

				Competitions will be a central focus, with USA Dance working closely with WDSF to host and promote events that attract top talent from across the country and beyond. These events will serve as qualifiers for international competitions, giving American dancers more opportunities to compete at the highest levels. Additionally, USA Dance will explore the possibility of hosting major WDSF-sanctioned events, such as GrandSlams and World Championships, in the U.S. This will not only bring international attention to American DanceSport but also inspire a new generation of dancers.

				To support this growth, USA Dance will expand its youth programs, focusing on introducing DanceSport to schools and community centers nationwide. By fostering an early interest in competitive dance, USA Dance hopes to build a strong pipeline of young talent that will sustain the sport’s growth for years to come. These programs will be designed to align with WDSF’s youth initiatives, ensuring that young American dancers are prepared to compete internationally from an early age.

				Marketing and promotion will play a key role in the development strategy. USA Dance will collaborate with WDSF to leverage media coverage and digital platforms to increase the visibility of DanceSport in the U.S. This includes live streaming of competitions, social media campaigns, and partnerships with brands that resonate with the dance community. By raising the profile of DanceSport, USA Dance aims to attract more participants, sponsors, and spectators, thereby increasing its financial stability and ability to reinvest in the sport.

				In the long term, the collaboration between USA Dance and WDSF will be centered on sustainability and continuous improvement. USA Dance will regularly review and update its programs, competitions, and training initiatives to reflect the latest developments in the global DanceSport community. This ongoing alignment with WDSF will ensure that American DanceSport remains at the forefront of the international scene, providing opportunities for athletes to achieve their full potential and for the sport to thrive in the U.S.

				Through this partnership with WDSF, USA Dance will not only elevate the standard of DanceSport in the U.S. but also solidify its position as a key player in the global dance community. The focus will be on building a strong, sustainable foundation that supports the growth and success of American dancers on the world stage, while also promoting the sport to new audiences nationwide.</p>

			<p className="mb-4">
				Creating sport programs for kids that can compete with other popular sports in the USA, like football, basketball, or soccer, requires a strategic approach. USA Dance can leverage the growing interest in dance, the benefits of physical activity, and the appeal of competition to attract young participants. Here’s a detailed plan:
